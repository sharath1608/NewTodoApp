# NewTodoApp
This app is the capstone project for the Android Nanodegree course by Udacity. Please read the UI mockup document to get a feel of how this
project began.
This is a location sensitive reminder app that will allow you to keep notes and get notifications based on your location and/or time set. 
To use this app, you will need a key for accessing UPC Database (upcdatabase.com). This feature will enable the user to scan barcodes for 
products to add to the list of items to do.
